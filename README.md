# Training

## ConEmu
Using ConEmu which is apparently a nicer version of a terminal (I'm inclined to agree) I managed to learn the following commands in order to make a new directory named "Code" for all future learning purposes. Andre said that I would need to use the terminal in future for everything I do instead of the Window GUI.
Commands:
(explainshell.com
ls = List files in current directory
cd = Move to directory
cd.. = Move upwards a directory
mkdir = Make new directory
- = Used for any commands that's going to be made
ls -lart= l: list
	  -a : include entries with.
	  -r : sort in reverse order.
	  -t : sort by modification time
~ = Refers to root directory

## Vi
Vi is a visual editor that is difficult to learn and so only learned to a certain degree where it is useful. It helped me to create a new bash profile which enabled me to make shortcuts, an example being ".." to navigate upwards a folder instead of "cd.."

## Bash_Profile
	A Bash Profile, as stated earlier, is a way to create shortcuts through the use of aliases and shell functions. An alias is a shortcut to commands. For example, in order to shorten the command to edit my Bash profile, I have typed "alias ea = "vi ~/.bash_profile"	in order to just type the alias "ea" to access and edit. Everytime an edit has been made to the profile it has to be reloaded into memory. I have also made an alias for this under the name "ra" which is the alias for the commands "source ~/.bash_profile". Keep in mind "~" refers to the root directory of the machine. 

## Setting Up Git
Setting up Git involved setting up an ssh key to be able to clone the files in my git repository into my local directory.
Using ssh-keygen (SSH standing for Secure Shell) to be put into the Git settings to allow access to the repository to pair keys with the authentication agent? ( Will need clarification).
